A brief explanation of the information system program we are working on using C ++ and SQLite.

This program is aimed at the train ticket train counter. This program is still in semi-finished work due to time and knowledge constraints. If we were given more time or learned more about the information system, maybe we could finish the program well and perfect.

The program we created is open source. If you wish to forward or modify this program, you can download it.

the program code along with the database can be downloaded at the following link:
